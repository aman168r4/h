## What is Bootstrap Studio?

Bootstrap Studio is a desktop application designed to simplify and accelerate the website development process. It's built around the Bootstrap framework, a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. What makes Bootstrap Studio stand out is its drag-and-drop interface and extensive library of pre-built components, allowing you to visually assemble your website's structure and design.
