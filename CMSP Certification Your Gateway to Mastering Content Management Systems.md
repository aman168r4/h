The core purpose of such certifications is to demonstrate:

*   **Deep understanding of CMS functionalities:** You know the ins and outs of your chosen CMS, including content creation, user management, security settings, and more.
*   **Ability to customize and extend CMS capabilities:** You can tailor the CMS to meet specific business needs through plugins, themes, and custom development.
