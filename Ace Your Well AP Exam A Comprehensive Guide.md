*   **Air:** Optimizing indoor air quality through ventilation, filtration, and source control.
*   **Water:** Ensuring access to clean and safe drinking water through filtration, testing, and management.

Each concept is further divided into Features, which are specific requirements or strategies that projects must implement to achieve WELL certification. Features are categorized as either Preconditions (mandatory) or Optimizations (optional).
