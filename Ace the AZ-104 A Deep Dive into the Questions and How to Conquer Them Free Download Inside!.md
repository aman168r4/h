*   **Compute (20-25%):** This domain focuses on deploying and managing virtual machines (VMs), configuring VM scale sets, implementing Azure App Service, and managing containers.
*   **Networking (15-20%):** The networking section covers configuring virtual networks, implementing network security groups (NSGs), setting up Azure DNS, and managing load balancing solutions.
*   **Monitoring (10-15%):** You'll be evaluated on your ability to configure Azure Monitor, implement alerts, and analyze logs.

The questions on the exam are designed to assess your practical knowledge and your ability to apply Azure services to solve real-world problems. Therefore, a deep understanding of these domains and hands-on experience with Azure are essential for success.

## Common AZ-104 Question Types

The AZ-104 exam utilizes various question formats to test your understanding of Azure. Here's a breakdown of some common types:

*   **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs):** These are the most common type, where you select the best answer from a list of options. MCQs can test your knowledge of specific concepts, configuration settings, or troubleshooting steps.

    *   *Example:* You need to create a storage account that provides the lowest cost for infrequently accessed data. Which storage account type should you choose?

        a) Standard general-purpose v2

        b) Premium block blobs

        c) Storage (general-purpose v1)

        d) Standard blob storage

*   **Multiple Select Questions:** Similar to MCQs, but you must select *all* the correct answers from a list. These questions often require a more thorough understanding of a topic.

    *   *Example:* Which of the following Azure services can be used to monitor the performance of a virtual machine? (Select all that apply.)

        a) Azure Monitor

        b) Azure Security Center

        c) Azure Advisor

        d) Azure Service Health

*   **Drag and Drop Questions:** These questions require you to drag and drop items to the correct location on a diagram or table. They often test your understanding of Azure architecture and how different services interact.

    *   *Example:* Match each Azure service with its corresponding function. (Drag and drop the services to the appropriate function.)

        *   Azure Virtual Machines
        *   Azure App Service
        *   Azure Container Instances

        *Functions:*

            *   Hosting web applications
            *   Running containerized applications
            *   Running virtual machines

*   **Hotspot Questions:** These questions present a scenario with an image, and you must click on the correct area within the image to answer the question. This tests your ability to identify specific elements within the Azure portal or architectural diagrams.

    *   *Example:* The image shows the Azure portal. Click on the area where you would create a new virtual machine.

*   **Case Study Questions:** These questions present a detailed scenario describing a business problem and the requirements for a solution. You'll then be asked several questions related to the scenario, requiring you to apply your knowledge to design and implement an Azure solution.

    *   *Example:* A company needs to migrate its on-premises servers to Azure. They require a solution that provides high availability and disaster recovery. The solution must also minimize costs. Which Azure services should they use?

*   **Fill-in-the-Blank Questions:** These questions require you to type in the correct answer to complete a statement. These questions can test your knowledge of specific commands, parameters, or configuration values.

    *   *Example:* To assign a user to a role in Azure, you can use the `New-AzRoleAssignment` cmdlet in Azure PowerShell. The `-Scope` parameter specifies the ______ at which the role assignment applies.
