*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):**  Implement strong IAM controls to manage user access to cloud resources.  Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.
*   **Incident Response:**  Develop and implement incident response plans for cloud environments.

**4. Cloud Application Security (17%)**

This domain focuses on securing cloud-based applications, including web applications, mobile apps, and APIs. You need to understand how to build secure applications using secure coding practices, perform security testing, and implement appropriate security controls at the application layer. Key areas include:

*   **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC):**  Integrate security into the SDLC to build secure applications from the ground up.
*   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows.
*   **Security Testing:**  Perform regular security testing, such as penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify and remediate security flaws.
*   **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):**  Implement WAFs to protect web applications from attacks.
*   **API Security:**  Secure APIs using authentication, authorization, and encryption.
*   **DevSecOps:**  Integrate security into the DevOps pipeline to automate security testing and deployment.

**5. Cloud Security Operations (17%)**

This domain focuses on the operational aspects of cloud security, including monitoring, logging, incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity. You need to understand how to monitor cloud environments for security threats, respond to incidents effectively, and ensure business continuity in the event of a disruption. Key areas include:

*   **Security Monitoring:**  Implement security monitoring tools and techniques to detect and respond to security threats.
