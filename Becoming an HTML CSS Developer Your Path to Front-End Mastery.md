## What are HTML and CSS?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the language used to structure the content of a web page. Think of it as the skeleton of a website. It uses elements, defined by tags, to tell the browser how to display text, images, links, and other content. Examples of HTML tags include:

*   `<p>`: Represents a paragraph of text.
*   `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Represent headings of different levels.
*   `<img>`: Embeds an image.
*   `<a>`: Creates a hyperlink.
*   `<div>`: Defines a division or section in an HTML document.
*   `<ul>` and `<li>`: Create unordered lists and list items, respectively.
*   `<ol>` and `<li>`: Create ordered lists and list items, respectively.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**, on the other hand, controls the presentation and visual appearance of the HTML content. It dictates things like colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness. Think of CSS as the skin and clothing of the website's skeleton. It allows you to transform a plain HTML page into a visually appealing and engaging experience. Key CSS concepts include:

*   **Selectors:**  Target specific HTML elements to apply styles.
*   **Properties:** Define the stylistic characteristics you want to change (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `margin`).
*   **Values:**  Specify the values for the properties (e.g., `color: blue;`, `font-size: 16px;`).
*   **Box Model:** Understand how elements are rendered as rectangular boxes with content, padding, border, and margin.
*   **Layout:**  Control the positioning and arrangement of elements on the page using techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

## Why are HTML and CSS Important?

*   **Foundation of the Web:**  Every website uses HTML and CSS. Understanding these languages is fundamental to web development.
*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** CSS ensures that your website looks consistent across different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
*   **Responsive Design:**  CSS allows you to create websites that adapt to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, smartphones), providing an optimal user experience on any device.
*   **Maintainability:** By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), you can easily update the styling of your website without modifying the underlying structure.
*   **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):**  Properly structured HTML and CSS contribute to a website's SEO, making it easier for search engines to crawl and index your content.
