Whether you're just starting your PMP journey or are well into your studies, understanding the content outline is essential for success.

## What is the PMI Exam Content Outline?

The PMI Exam Content Outline (ECO) serves as the foundational document that defines the structure and content of the PMP exam. It's essentially a roadmap that tells you exactly what knowledge, skills, and abilities PMI expects you to demonstrate to pass the exam. Think of it as the syllabus for your PMP exam course.  It's not just a list of topics; it provides a framework for understanding how different project management aspects interrelate and contribute to successful project outcomes.

The ECO is regularly updated by PMI to reflect the evolving landscape of project management practices. The current ECO, released in 2021, places a greater emphasis on Agile and hybrid approaches, recognizing the shift in how projects are managed in today's dynamic environment.

## Key Domains in the PMP Exam Content Outline

The ECO is structured around three high-level domains, each representing a critical aspect of project management:

1.  **People (42%):** This domain focuses on the skills and activities associated with effectively leading a project team. It encompasses aspects like building, managing, and supporting the team; motivating and engaging stakeholders; and fostering collaboration.
2.  **Process (50%):**  This domain covers the technical aspects of managing a project. It includes tasks related to initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing projects.  This is where you'll find concepts from the PMBOK® Guide, such as project integration management, scope management, schedule management, cost management, quality management, resource management, communications management, risk management, procurement management, and stakeholder management.
3.  **Business Environment (8%):** This domain highlights the connection between projects and organizational strategy. It focuses on ensuring that projects align with the business goals and deliver value to the organization. Topics include benefits management, organizational governance, and compliance.

Each of these domains is further broken down into tasks, which are the specific actions and responsibilities expected of a project manager. Under each task, there are enablers, which are examples of the work associated with the task. The tasks and enablers provide a more granular understanding of the knowledge and skills that will be assessed on the exam.
